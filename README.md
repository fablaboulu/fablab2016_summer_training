#Project summary
This repo contains the results of a two-week summer training (06.06.2016 - 17.06.2016) of a group of 14 high-schoolers and secondary school students (15 -18 years) at **[FabLab Oulu](http://www.oulu.fi/fablab/) (University of Oulu, Finland)**. 

During the training participants familiarised with FabLab concept, machines and tools. They learnt how to create a Arduino Shield from scratch, including several sensors and actuators, how to use a 3D printer and a laser cutter to create the mechanics for an electronic device as well as Arduino programming principles. The training followed a practical approach. Trainees created a robot that meets the requirements provided during the first day. 

The trainees were divided in 4 teams. They had to implement an alarm-bot which is able to move, make noise and turn-on/off the lights. The only way of stopping the robot is catching it up and shake it. Each team implemented a different robot: 
* An owl
* A frog
* A foot
* A UFO

This summer training program is possible thanks to the financial support of **City of Oulu**, **FabLab Oulu**, and the  **Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (University of Oulu) through the project FabLab4School**.


#Project structure
There is one folder per team. Each folder includes:
 * Eagle files for the arduino shield
 * 2D/3D models for the mechanics
 * Arduino source code

In addition there is one folder named instructor in which I have placed the Arduino code that was created by the instructor as a guideline. 

#Software utilized:
We utilized the following software:
##2D/3D models
* Inkscape (.svg)
* Freecad (.FCStd1, .stl)
* Autodesk 123d (.123dx)
* MeshMixer (.mix)
## Schematics
* Eagle(.brd, .sch)

##Coding
* Arduino (.ino)
